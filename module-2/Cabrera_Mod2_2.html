    <p class="intro">Hello, my name is Bryan Cabrera. I was born in Los Angeles but lived in Phoenix for 23 years. For the past year I've been living in Vancouver Washington.</p>
    <p><span class="sentence">My hobbies include playing video games, I try to play the latest games as they come out and escpecially Star Wars related games.</span> Speaking of Star Wars I love all of the movies and shows. I one day plan to visit Disney Land in order to visit the new Star Wars attraction location!</p>
    <p>I also love to watch and play soccer. My favorite teams are FC Barcelona, Porland Timbers, and the US mens national team.</p>
    <p>Recently I've started my new degree journey to get my bachelors in Software Development. I plan on doing more programming on the side in place of video games in order to work on personal projects. I one day plan to enter a new career field in software by obtaining a Software Development/Engineer position after I graduate!</p>
